Proof of concept CSS only Lightbox  
http://perfundo.oberlehner.net

### Usage
This is a proof of concept and not intended (although absolutely possible) to use in real world projects. There most certainly are accessibility problems with this lightbox solution - I'm no expert on this topic, if anyone can help with improvements in this regard please use [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/maoberlehner/perfundo/issues/10).

The perfect use case for this solution is a project where speed is an absolute top priority - you have already axed jQuery and some related plugins but there are those few images you want to display in a lightbox - under these circumstances a lightweight solution like this would be a pefect fit. Another possibility is to use this solution as a fallback if JavaScript is not available (e.g. loading of scripts fails,...)

The usability with mobile devices is not exactly the best because there is no way (I'm aware of) to make touch gestures do anything with pure CSS.
